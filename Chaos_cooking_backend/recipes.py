# Recipe Back-end Logic
"""Import everything that is needed from other files"""



# Define the many-to-many table

"""Recipes should have to the User-id that created it"""

# Create a Recipe class
"""
    Recipe class:
    Recipe Title
    Recipe id - Unique ID for recipes
    Created_by - User-ID that added the recipe
    Created_at
    Updated_at
    Description? - Brief explanation of Recipe
    Ingredients - Ingredients needed
    Method - How to make the recipe
    Time - How long it takes to make
    Difficulty? - How easy or challenging the recipe is
    Reviews? - A few reviews if the recipe is public?
